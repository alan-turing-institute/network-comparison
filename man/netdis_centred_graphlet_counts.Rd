\title{Generate Netdis centred graphlets counts by subtracting expected counts}
\usage{
netdis_centred_graphlet_counts(graph, max_graphlet_size,
  neighbourhood_size, expected_ego_count_fn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A connected, undirected, simple graph as an \code{igraph} object.}

\item{max_graphlet_size}{Determines the maximum size of graphlets to count. 
Only graphlets containing up to \code{max_graphlet_size} nodes will be counted.}

\item{neighbourhood_size}{The number of steps from the source node to include
nodes for each ego-network.}

\item{expected_ego_count_fn}{A function for generating expected ego-network
graphlet counts for a graph. This function should take a connected, 
undirected, simple graph as an \code{igraph} object for its only argument. 
Where \code{expected_ego_count_fn} is specific to particular values of 
\code{max_graphlet_size} or \code{neighbourhood_size}, care should be taken 
to ensure that the values of these parameters passed to this function are
consistent with those used when creating \code{expected_ego_count_fn}.}
}
\value{
A vector with centred counts for each graphlet type
}
