\description{
Calculates the minimum Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two discrete
histograms using an exhaustive search.
}
\details{
When "sliding" two piecewise-linear empirical cumulative mass functions
(ECMFs) across each other to minimise the EMD between them, it is sufficient
to calculate the EMD at all offsets where any knots from the two ECMFs align
to ensure that the offset with the global minimum EMD is found.

This is because of the piece-wise linear nature of the two ECMFs. Between any
two offsets where knots from the two ECMFs align, EMD will be either
constant, or uniformly increasing or decreasing. Therefore, there the EMD
between two sets of aligned knots cannot be smaller than the EMD at one or
other of the bounding offsets.
