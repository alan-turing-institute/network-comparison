\usage{
net_emd(
  dhists_1,
  dhists_2,
  method = "optimise",
  return_details = FALSE,
  smoothing_window_width = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dhists_1}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object or a list of such objects}

\item{dhists_2}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object or a list of such objects}

\item{method}{The method to use to find the minimum EMD across all potential
offsets for each pair of histograms. Default is "optimise" to use
R's built-in \code{stats::optimise} method to efficiently find the offset
with the minimal EMD. However, this is not guaranteed to find the global
minimum if multiple local minima EMDs exist. You can alternatively specify the
"exhaustive" method, which will exhaustively evaluate the EMD between the
histograms at all offsets that are candidates for the minimal EMD.}

\item{return_details}{Logical indicating whether to return the individual
minimal EMDs and associated offsets for all pairs of histograms}

\item{smoothing_window_width}{Width of "top-hat" smoothing window to apply to
"smear" point masses across a finite width in the real domain. Default is 0,
which  results in no smoothing. Care should be taken to select a
\code{smoothing_window_width} that is appropriate for the discrete domain
(e.g.for the integer domain a width of 1 is the natural choice)}
}
\value{
NetEMD measure for the two sets of discrete histograms
(\code{return_details = FALSE}) or a list with the following named elements
\code{net_emd}: the NetEMD for the set of histogram pairs, \code{min_emds}:
the minimal EMD for each pair of histograms, \code{min_offsets}: the associated
offsets giving the minimal EMD for each pair of histograms
}
\description{
Calculates the mean minimum Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two sets of
discrete histograms after normalising each histogram to unit mass and variance.
This is calculated as follows:
  1. Normalise each histogram to have unit mass and unit variance
  2. Find the minimum EMD between each pair of histograms
  3. Take the average minimum EMD across all histogram pairs
