\usage{
net_emd(dhists1, dhists2, method = "optimise", return_details = FALSE,
  smoothing_window_width = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{The method to use to find the minimum EMD across all potential 
offsets for each pair of histograms. Default is "optimise".
\itemize {
 \item \code{optimise}: Default. Uses an optimiser to efficiently find the offset 
 with the minimal EMD. However, this is not guaranteed to find the global 
 minimum if multiple local minima EMDs exist. See \code{min_emd_optimise}
 for any method-specific arguments.
 \item Exhaustively evaluate the EMD between the histograms at all offsets that
 are candidates for the minimal EMD.See \code{min_emd_exhaustive}
 for any method-specific arguments.
 \item Evaluate the EMD between the histograms at a series of offsets separated
 by a fixed step and spanning the range of overalap of the two histograms. See 
 \code{min_emd_fixed_step} for any method-specific arguments.
}}

\item{return_details}{Logical indicating whether to return the individual
minimal EMDs and associated offsets for all pairs of histograms}

\item{smoothing_window_width}{Width of "top-hat" smoothing window to apply to
"smear" point masses across a finite width in the real domain. Default is 0, 
which  results in no smoothing. Care should be taken to select a 
\code{smoothing_window_width} that is appropriate for the discrete domain 
(e.g.for the integer domain a width of 1 is the natural choice)}

\item{...}{Method-specific arguments to be passed to the specific
method used to calculate the minimum EMD}

\item{dhist1}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object}

\item{dhist2}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object}
}
\value{
NetEMD measure for the two sets of discrete histograms 
(\code{return_details = FALSE}) or a list with the following named elements
\code{net_emd}: the NetEMD for the set of histogram pairs, \code{min_emds}:  
the minimal EMD for each pair of histograms, \code{min_offsets}: the associated
offsets giving the minimal EMD for each pair of histograms
}
\description{
Calculates the mean minimum Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two sets of
discrete histograms after normalising each histogram to unit mass and variance.
This is calculated as follows:
  1. Normalise each histogram to have unit mass and unit variance
  2. Find the minimum EMD between each pair of histograms
  3. Take the average minimum EMD across all histogram pairs
