\title{Minimum Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) using fixed step search}
\usage{
min_emd_fixed_step(dhist1, dhist2, step_size = 0.01 * min_location_spacing())
}
\arguments{
\item{dhist1}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object}

\item{dhist2}{A \code{dhist} discrete histogram object}

\item{step_size}{The size of the fixed step at which to evaluate 
candidate offsets for the minimum EMD between the two histograms. Default is
to use a small fraction of the minimum spacing between adjacent locations
for either histogram}
}
\value{
Earth Mover's Distance between the two discrete histograms
}
\description{
Calculates the minimum Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two discrete 
histograms using a fixed step search.
