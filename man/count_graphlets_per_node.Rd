\title{Count graphlets for each node in a graph}
\usage{
count_graphlets_per_node(graph, max_graphlet_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A connected, undirected, simple graph as an \code{igraph} object}

\item{max_graphlet_size}{Determines the maximum size of graphlets to count.
Only graphlets containing up to \code{max_graphlet_size} nodes will be
counted.}
}
\value{
ORCA-format matrix containing counts of each graphlet (columns) at
each node in the graph (rows).
}
\description{
Calculates graphlet counts for each node in an \code{igraph} graph object,
using the ORCA fast graphlet orbit counting package. by summing orbits over
graphlets.
}
